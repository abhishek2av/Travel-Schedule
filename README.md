Travel-Schedule
===============
The application has a main Activity screen showing two spinners(dropdowns) to choose source and destination airports. The corresponding flights are checked for and their weekly schedule result is displayed. The project is still in progress as functionality to retrieve travel data other than flight schedule has to be implemented.

The flight information is obtained from www.mapsofindia.com/flight-schedule
