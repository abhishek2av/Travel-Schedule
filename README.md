Travel-Schedule
===============
The application has a main Activity screen showing two spinners(dropdowns) to 

choose source and destination airports. The corresponding flights are checked 

for and their weekly schedule result is displayed. The project is still in progress as retrieval of travel data other than flights can also be implemented.

The flight information is obtained from www.mapsofindia.com/flight-schedule
